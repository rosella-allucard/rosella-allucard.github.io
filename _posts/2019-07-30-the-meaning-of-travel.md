旅行是件好事情。虽然有时你会感到疲倦，有时还会感到失望，不过那里肯定会有“什么东西”。来吧，请你也行动起来，出发去旅行吧。
——村上春树《假如真有时光机》

大概两年前的暑假，听到了*旅行的意义*这首歌，当时和听其他的歌一样，只觉得旋律很好听，歌名、歌词，就像流水一样划过，没有在记忆中留下任何痕迹。

后来，又看了新井一二三的*独立 从一个人旅行开始*，不禁对一个人的旅行产生无限遐想。

而如今，当自己真的一个人在旅途中时，便开始询问自己“旅行的意义究竟是什么？”，而那首歌的歌词也再次浮出水面。

然而，前几天看到的一个up主拍的一个[vlog](<https://www.bilibili.com/video/av60140367>)，很好的回答了这个令我纠结困惑的问题。

“Sometimes we feel lonely. When this feeling comes, we can become more lonely. It's like a monster, like a heavy dark sky.”

"For a two years, I slowly lost interest in everything, but also gradually lost emotions. I became no longer angry, eager, happy or excited, the only thing is sad. And then, there is no sadness anymore. As if, blend in with me. So I think I need to stop and feel. I stopped thinking about the future. I stopped what I was doing."

"In 2018, the third time before I went on a journey alone, unlike the calm and feeling of accepting the world, this time I was extremely unhappy and anxious. So if it didn't make me get rid of my sadness, what should I do? People are deeply influenced by romanticism and consumerism, so when our lives become anxious or upset, we always hear people say 'go travel',  because we think it's a new experience, a new adventure that will gain more experience, maybe will help us grow or change a bit. But is it?"

"Now that we are living in such a vast and complex world of imagination, a journey may indeed find my connection to the world. Every trip has given me a taste of the greatness and splendour, diversity and beauty of our planet. I learned about all kinds of culture and art and slowly felt the 'love', which comes from all kinds of people in the world. And every trip has charged my consciousness to a certain extent, large and small. In my opinion, there is no such a way to go from 'childish' to 'mature', because people have been always changing and growing up."

除了有些蹩脚的英语，我真的非常喜欢这个短片。

世界这么大，这就是我要去旅行的意义，我要欣赏不同的风景，接触不同的文化，与不同的人交谈。

而“观察”则是我与这一切的联系。
