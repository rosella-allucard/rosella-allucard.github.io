Rosella loved sunset—magnificent yet tragic, like a dying beauty. She knew how fast the scene would fade, so to keep her eyes fixed on the distance. Standing alone on the balcony, Rosella felt the gentle touch of the wind. The city was quite. The only sound was the bird singing from she don't know where—heralding the arrival of spring. The red lower horizon imperceptibly gradates to join the bright blue sky. Clouds seemed to be burning, and the pigment inside poured out on the backdrop. Rosella caught great pleasure in those kind of things that didn't speak.

It seemed promising that a better tomorrow was coming. She felt much better. It was the first day of this semester, a special online semester—since most people were trapped at home due to this epidemic, universities determined students should take classes online.

Rosella dreaded of school even since she was a little girl. She hardly understood why so many pupils couldn't wait for school after a long vacation. She would probably never go to school if possible. And this time, she found out that it wasn't going to school that frightened her, but the classes themselves.

However, the sunny first day of the online semester turned out to be a splendid new start. Rosella loved sunny days in winter. The tentacles of the winter sun reached every corner on the earth. Clouds in the serene sky demonstrated the character of south. The warmth seemed to sweep away all her melancholy.

The serenity gave her the courage to welcome a first day.
